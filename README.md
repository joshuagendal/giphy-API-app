This app will allow users to search the giphy API and choose 4 of their favorite giphys from any search term provided. 

After the user picks four giphys, it will redirect them to a page where all four giphys will be displayed.

The branch 'rewrite' serves as the rewrite master branch, and rewrite-local will serve as local dev to add features to the rewrite branch. This will be merged later on with the master branch.
